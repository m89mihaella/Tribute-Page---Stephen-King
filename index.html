            <hr>

            <p>Stephen Edwin King was born in Portland, Maine in 1947, the second son of Donald and Nellie Ruth
                Pillsbury
                King. After his parents separated when Stephen was a toddler, he and his older brother, David, were
                raised
                by his mother. Parts of his childhood were spent in Fort Wayne, Indiana, where his father's family was
                at
                the time, and in Stratford, Connecticut. When Stephen was eleven, his mother brought her children back
                to
                Durham, Maine, for good. Her parents, Guy and Nellie Pillsbury, had become incapacitated with old age,
                and
                Ruth King was persuaded by her sisters to take over the physical care of the elderly couple. Other
                family
                members provided a small house in Durham and financial support. After Stephen's grandparents passed
                away,
                Mrs. King found work in the kitchens of Pineland, a nearby residential facility for the mentally
                challenged.</p>
            <br>

            <p>Stephen attended the grammar school in Durham and then Lisbon Falls High School, graduating in 1966.
                From
                his sophomore year at the University of Maine at Orono, he wrote a weekly column for the school
                newspaper,
                THE MAINE CAMPUS. He was also active in student politics, serving as a member of the Student Senate. He
                came
                to support the anti-war movement on the Orono campus, arriving at his stance from a conservative view
                that
                the war in Vietnam was unconstitutional. He graduated from the University of Maine at Orono in 1970,
                with a
                B.A. in English and qualified to teach on the high school level. A draft board examination immediately
                post-graduation found him 4-F on grounds of high blood pressure, limited vision, flat feet, and
                punctured
                eardrums.</p>
            <br>


            <p>He and Tabitha Spruce married in January of 1971. He met Tabitha in the stacks of the Fogler Library at
                the
                University of Maine at Orono, where they both worked as students. As Stephen was unable to find
                placement as
                a teacher immediately, the Kings lived on his earnings as a laborer at an industrial laundry, and her
                student loan and savings, with an occasional boost from a short story sale to men's magazines.

                Stephen made his first professional short story sale ("The Glass Floor") to Startling Mystery Stories in
                1967. Throughout the early years of his marriage, he continued to sell stories to men's magazines. Many
                of
                these were later gathered into the Night Shift collection or appeared in other anthologies.</p>
            <br>

            <p> In the fall of 1971, Stephen began teaching high school English classes at Hampden Academy, the public
                high
                school in Hampden, Maine. Writing in the evenings and on the weekends, he continued to produce short
                stories
                and to work on novels.

                In the spring of 1973, Doubleday & Co. accepted the novel Carrie for publication. On Mother's Day of
                that
                year, Stephen learned from his new editor at Doubleday, Bill Thompson, that a major paperback sale would
                provide him with the means to leave teaching and write full-time.

                At the end of the summer of 1973, the Kings moved their growing family to southern Maine because of
                Stephen's mother's failing health. Renting a summer home on Sebago Lake in North Windham for the winter,
                Stephen wrote his next-published novel, originally titled Second Coming and then Jerusalem's Lot, before
                it
                became 'Salem's Lot, in a small room in the garage. During this period, Stephen's mother died of cancer,
                at
                the age of 59.</p>
            <br>

            <p> Carrie was published in the spring of 1974. That same fall, the Kings left Maine for Boulder, Colorado.
                They
                lived there for a little less than a year, during which Stephen wrote The Shining, set in Colorado.
                Returning to Maine in the summer of 1975, the Kings purchased a home in the Lakes Region of western
                Maine.
                At that house, Stephen finished writing The Stand, much of which also is set in Boulder. The Dead Zone
                was
                also written in Bridgton.

                In 1977, the Kings spent three months of a projected year-long stay in England, cut the sojourn short
                and
                returned home in mid-December, purchasing a new home in Center Lovell, Maine. After living there one
                summer,
                the Kings moved north to Orrington, near Bangor, so that Stephen could teach creative writing at the
                University of Maine at Orono. The Kings returned to Center Lovell in the spring of 1979. In 1980, the
                Kings
                purchased a second home in Bangor, retaining the Center Lovell house as a summer home.</p>
            <br>

            <p>Stephen and Tabitha now spend winters in Florida and the remainder of the year at their Bangor and
                Center
                Lovell homes.

                The Kings have three children: Naomi Rachel, Joe Hill and Owen Phillip, and four grandchildren.

                Stephen is of Scots-Irish ancestry, stands 6'4" and weighs about 200 pounds. He is blue-eyed,
                fair-skinned,
                and has thick, black hair, with a frost of white most noticeable in his beard, which he sometimes wears
                between the end of the World Series and the opening of baseball spring training in Florida. Occasionally
                he
                wears a moustache in other seasons. He has worn glasses since he was a child.</p><br>

            <p>He has put some of his college dramatic society experience to use doing cameos in several of the film
                adaptations of his works as well as a bit part in a George Romero picture, Knightriders. Joe Hill King
                also
                appeared in Creepshow, which was released in 1982. Stephen made his directorial debut, as well as
                writing
                the screenplay, for the movie Maximum Overdrive (an adaptation of his short story "Trucks") in 1985.

                Stephen and Tabitha provide scholarships for local high school students and contribute to many other
                local
                and national charities.

                Stephen is the 2003 recipient of The National Book Foundation Medal for Distinguished Contribution to
                American Letters and the 2014 National Medal of Arts.</p>
